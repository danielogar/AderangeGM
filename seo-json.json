Unlike amethysts from other regions, Nigerian specimens often display a distinctive royal purple hue with occasional flashes of red undertones when exposed to bright light. This unique characteristic is attributed to the specific geological conditions found in Nigeria's Jos Plateau region, where iron impurities within the quartz have undergone natural irradiation over millions of years.\n\nMiners and gemologists value Nigerian amethyst for its impressive crystal formations, which can range from delicate clusters to substantial individual points exceeding 20cm in length. The hardness rating of 7 on the Mohs scale makes Nigerian amethyst exceptionally durable for jewelry applications, while maintaining excellent cutting properties for fine faceting work."
